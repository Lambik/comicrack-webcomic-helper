Webcomic Helper Version 1.0

By Stonepaw and Helmic

This script will allow you to easily read just about any webcomic on the Internet from within ComicRack. Read the entire archive without waiting for each page to load, get automatic updates for new pages, and of course view and manage your webcomics just like any other e-comic.

Simply install the plugin, go to File -> Automation, and then select Webcomic Helper. Follow the on-screen instructions and the script will make a .CBW file (a 1-3 KB XML file), which will load the comic pages off of the official site. The CBW file itself will contain no image files.

The script, while it works for 99% of webcomics, isn't guaranteed to work for everything. If you find an example of the script not catching every page or not working at all for a particular webcomic, please let us know.
